The goal of the project is to create a digital tool that aims to visualize and locate on a map the location of programs and projects of universities social commitment, also access a summary of the initiatives and contact data of the areas of the university that are carrying it out.

In this way, it seeks to facilitate access to information with the aim of promoting articulation, inter-institutional work and giving greater visibility to organizations and extra-university groups with which projects are carried out.

To fulfill the described objective, a web application will be created with a map where you can visualize the different points of interest. When navigating over them you will have access to the information corresponding to each of the points.

A management module will also be available that will allow adding, editing and deleting the geolocable points with their corresponding information.

The application will have the possibility of logging in to access additional functionalities:

- Administrator: can add, delete, modify all projects and give permission to other users.
- Writer: with this permission can only add new projects.
